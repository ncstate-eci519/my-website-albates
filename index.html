	<p class="text-wheat">In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies and activities.  I read legal thrillers by John Grisham, Greg Iles, Tess Gerritsen and others.  I enjoying cooking and baking, having perfected an "Old Fashion" pound cake recipe.  Lastly, I like to travel.  My goal is to visit at least one historical site every summer!</p>

I hope to be able to design online instruction for universities and colleges, once I graduate from NC State University.
