I have found that these tools help to make the student's experiences in the classroom more engaging and enjoyable.  Check out some of my favorite ed tech tools:</p>

I am a 17 year veteran teacher.  I have taught multiple facets of the 9-12 social studies curriculum over my career. For most of my career, I have focused on teaching American History. Currently, I am teaching at a small charter school in western North Carolina.  I hope to be able to design online instruction for universities and colleges, once I graduate from NC State University.	
In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies and activities.  I read legal thrillers by John Grisham, Greg Iles, Tess Gerritsen and others.  I enjoying cooking and baking, having perfected an "Old Fashion" pound cake recipe.  Lastly, I like to travel.  My goal is to visit at least one historical site every summer!</p>
