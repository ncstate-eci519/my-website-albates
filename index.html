	<h2><em><b>All About Me!</b></em></h2>

<main>

	<p>In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies and activities.  I read legal thrillers by John Grisham, Greg Iles, Tess Gerritsen and others.  I enjoying cooking and baking, having perfected an "Old Fashion" pound cake recipe.  Lastly, I like to travel.  My goal is to visit at least one historical site every summer!</p>
	<p>I am a 17 year veteran teacher.  I have taught multiple facets of the 9-12 social studies curriculum over my career. For most of my career, I have focused on teaching American History. Currently, I am teaching at a small charter school in western North Carolina.  I hope to be able to design online instruction for universities and colleges, once I graduate from NC State University.  When planning for classes, I like to use a variety of software and ed tech tools to enhance the quality of my lessons.  I have found that these tools help to make the student's experiences in the classroom more engaing and enjoyable.  Check out some of my favorite ed tech tools:</p>
